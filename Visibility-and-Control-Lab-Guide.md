# PRISMA CLOUD VISIBILITY AND CONTROL BOOTCAMP


### Lab Introduction

Thank you for joining todayâ€™s Visibility and Control camp. The lab will focus on the ways
that Prisma Cloud can help you secure cloud assets through posture and compliance tools.

Before we begin the lab let's start with a brief overview of the scenario to help frame the
context.

### Scenario

The Exampli Corp, a mock corporation, is rushing to build a number of cloud based applications before their fiscal year ends.
Up against challenging deadlines, the development and infrastructure teams are working
around the clock to get their app built, tested, and released to hit their goals.

Fortunately, Exampli Corp recently integrated Prisma Cloud into their development lifecycle
adopting security from code to cloud. Once in production Exampli Corps operations
and security teams continue to leverage Prisma Cloud to monitor and protect runtime
resources, reduce the attack surface, and enforce least privilege.

Will The Exampli Corp team take the time to build a secure app? Or will the stress of rushing to complete their apps in time lead to mistakes?

### Exercise

#### Cloud Security Posture Management

The cloud allows organizations to build and run scalable applications with great agility and resilience. However, the cloud also presents unique security challenges. Ensuring applications and services are secure at runtime is a core responsibility for security teams. CSPM tools can reduce the burden on cloud security teams by automating routine security monitoring, audits and remediations, allowing security teams to focus on high-priority items and prevent configuration drift. 

In this section you will explore how Prisma Cloud can help security teams inventory the applications and services running in their multi-cloud footprint. 

1. Login to [Prisma Cloud](https://app3.prismacloud.io/login).

2. Use the credentials provided by your Instructor to authenticate.

3. Let's start with taking a look at the **Asset Inventory** page to get an idea of the scale of resources that are being monitored by this particular Prisma Cloud tenant.

4. Begin by clicking on the **Inventory** tab at the top and click on **Assets**.

5. The **Asset Inventory** is a helpful page in Prisma Cloud where teams can get a high level view of their cloud assets and their compliance with defined policies. Without constant visibility of what is being deployed in your cloud footprint, you cannot begin to secure it.

6. Your screen should look similar to the one below:

![Alt text for image](/screenshots/shift_left/cloud-security-posture-management-4.png "Optional title")

7. Begin by clicking on **AWS** under the **Cloud** column.

In this section we explored the various filtered views of alerts discovered by Prisma Cloud. In the next section we will focus on Compliance. 

#### Compliance in the Cloud

Many organizations struggle maintaining a grasp on compliance in the cloud. So far we have inspected Exampli's IaC and found some troubling trends. Additionally, at runtime many assets are still vulnerable due to risky configurations and careless development practices.

With multiple upcoming compliance audits bearing down on Exampli's CISO's calendar it's time to begin reporting on what is in a failed state and what needs to be done to get the organization's cloud footprint compliant.

1. Start by clicking the **Compliance** tab at the top of the UI. This page provides a high level view of all the unique assets and their associated adherence to various compliance frameworks and policies. When Prisma Cloud detects a violation of a policy it generates an alert.

![Alt text for image](/screenshots/shift_left/compliance-in-the-cloud-1.png "Optional title")

2. Leverage the filters to adjust the results and select **GCP** for the **Cloud Type**. Refine the filters even more and select the compliance framework **CIS v1.1.0 (GCP)**.

![Alt text for image](/screenshots/shift_left/compliance-in-the-cloud-2.png "Optional title")

3. Click on the Compliance Standard Name from the results to see which services have policies applied for that standard. Prisma Cloud provides a nice breakdown of each service type for easy referencing.

4. This provides a focused view of Exampli's GCP footprint and its adherence to this CIS Standard.

It looks like the **Networking** service has a policy failure. Click on the red "i" icon under the **Failed** column. This will give us a view of the assets associated with the CIS policy failure. Your screen should look similar to the screen capture below :

![Alt text for image](/screenshots/shift_left/compliance-in-the-cloud-4.png "Optional title")

5. Click on the **Alert ID** associated with the **default** Asset name. A side window opens that provides an Overview, Recommendation, Asset Config and Alert Rules. Additionally, the alert can be sent to a third party integration, like JIRA, for automated ticket creation. Reports can also be generated so you'll be ready for the next assessment and audit.
